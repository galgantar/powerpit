# PowerPit
Graphics rendering engine based on OpenGL.

## Plans for the future
* Custom math library for vector transformations
* Lights (diffuse, spectral)
* Materials
* Meshes
* Fancy lightining (shadows, gamma correction, mapping)
* PBR (whatever the hell that means)
* .obj files
* Batch rendering
